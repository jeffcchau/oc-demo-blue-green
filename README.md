# cf-demo-simple-node

A simple Node.js app for OpenShift, which can be used to demonstrate:

- deployment of multiple versions
- blue/green deployment

## Blue/Green Deployments

Deploy different versions in a blue/green deployment with:
```
tba
```

Assuming an upgrade from version 1 to version 2, a blue/green deployment involves the addition of version 2 to the same route as the existing version 1 application, followed by the removal of version 1 from the existing route. This results in a switchover from version 1 to version 2 without relative unavailability.

Perform addition of version 2 to common route with:
```
tba
```

Perform addition of version 2 to common route with:
```
tba
```
